# Pine Email Framework

A modular and lightweight, responsive email framework by [ThemeMountain](http://thememountain.com/).

Inspired by the awesome [Foundation for Emails](https://github.com/zurb/foundation-emails), we created a framework that is lighter, flexible, and reliable.

There is no build system. Just a grid, some CSS, a few design patterns, and some awesome components.
Simply copy HTML and stack grid elements in a default layout file, then add your own content inside them.

## Features

- Compatible with major email clients, thoroughly tested
- Responsive, 12 column grid
- Interactive components (hamburger menu, accordions)
- Facilitates Outlook background image support
- Mobile breakpoint column sizes and offsets
- Alignment and visibility helpers
- Reverse column stacking on mobile
